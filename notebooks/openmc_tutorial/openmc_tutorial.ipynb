In it, we will show how to create a basic reflective pin-cell model that is equivalent to modeling an infinite array of fuel pins.

    "## Defining Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have three materials defined, exported to XML, and ready to be used in our model. To finish our model, we need to define the geometric arrangement of materials. OpenMC represents physical volumes using constructive solid geometry (CSG), also known as combinatorial geometry. The object that allows us to assign a material to a region of space is called a `Cell` (same concept in MCNP, for those familiar). There are four major stages in building a cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surfaces\n",
    "In order to define a region that we can assign to a cell, we must first define surfaces which bound the region. A *surface* is a locus of zeros of a function of Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A plane perpendicular to the x axis: $x - x_0 = 0$\n",
    "- A cylinder parallel to the z axis: $(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 - R^2 = 0$\n",
    "- A sphere: $(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 - R^2 = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Between those three classes of surfaces (planes, cylinders, spheres), one can construct a wide variety of models. It is also possible to define cones and general second-order surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Half-Spaces\n",
    "Note that defining a surface is not sufficient to specify a volume -- in order to define an actual volume, one must reference the half-space of a surface. A surface *half-space* is the region whose points satisfy a positive or negative inequality of the surface equation. For example, for a sphere of radius one centered at the origin, the surface equation is $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$. Thus, we say that the negative half-space of the sphere, is defined as the collection of points satisfying $f(x,y,z) < 0$, which one can reason is the inside of the sphere. Conversely, the positive half-space of the sphere would correspond to all points outside of the sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regions\n",
    "A region is then a combination (or just one) half-space.\n",
